# Who am I?

I'm a passionate software engineer and architect, specialising in node.js, React and distributed systems.

If you want you can [hire me on upwork](https://www.upwork.com/fl/fabiosantos6). My hourly rate varies depending on the job. See "What can I do for you?" below.

I'm the [terser](https://github.com/terser-js/terser) project maintainer, and I accept more help. The project is funded by [a patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/fabiosantoscode). Would you like to contribute?

# What have I done?

 * I have worked alongside a team to create the new [economist.com](https://www.economist.com/) website
 * I was the lead maintainer of the [Ink framework](http://ink.sapo.pt/) for two years
 * I took the DOM and Native out of React and created [react-applications, a dynamic state manager using React](https://github.com/fabiosantoscode/react-applications/).
 * I created a [Javascript to C++ transpiler](https://github.com/fabiosantoscode/js2cpp) which works for 10% of Javascript code
 * [I have created some npm modules](http://npmjs.com/~fabiosantoscode)
 * [My github repositories](http://github.com/fabiosantoscode), with plenty more stuff

# Talks

 * [React, GraphQL and Relay in practice](https://youtu.be/HrECWxWVcEI?t=58m16s) at the React London Meetup
 * [Front-end performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgUnjlwTzB4) at Fullstack LX 2017
 * [Creating a programming language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUVyBh_4Zn0) at require('lx') in 2018

# What can I do for you?

I'm a freelancer, and I can do many many things

 * Develop desktop, mobile or web applications using a variety of programming languages
 * Move your application to AWS lambda@edge, where it can respond to user requests from their own city
 * Architect distributed systems like websites and apps and more
 * Create a new programming language or write software that transforms codebases. I've created packages like [js2cpp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js2cpp) and [infralang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/infralang).
 * Optimise your javascrpt, HTML and CSS to make sure your website loads faster than the competition. More performance means more conversion (according to [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters/))!
